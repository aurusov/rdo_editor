		<P><A name="simulation"></A><B>Simulation on computers</B> finds broad applications for researching and controlling <A name="cds"></A><B>complex discrete systems (CDS) and processes going on in them</B>. Such systems include economic and manufacturing objects, sea ports, airports, oil or gas pipe lines, irrigation systems, software for complex control systems, computer networks and many others. Simulation is used so widely because the <B>dimension of the problems to be solved and the inability of complex systems to be formalised do not allow the application of strict optimising methods</B>. For example, the following problems in operations research can be specified that cannot be solved now or in the foreseeable future without simulation:</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>Establishing investment policy for prospective planning.</LI>
			<LI>Selecting service means or equipment for current planning.</LI>
			<LI>Developing plans with information feedback and operation prescriptions.</LI>
		</OL>
		<P>These classes of problems all feature <B>the necessity to take into account simultaneously indeterminacy factors, dynamic interconditioning of current decisions and subsequent events, complex interdependencies between the controlled variables of the system researched, and often discrete and strictly determined sequence of time intervals</B>. The specified features are encountered not only in operations research but in any complex system.</P>
		<P>A simulation experiment allows us:</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>to draw conclusions about the CDS behaviour and features:</LI>
				<UL>
					<LI>without building it, if the system is still at the design stage;</LI>
					<LI>without interfering with its operation if the system is running and experiments on it are expensive or hazardous;</LI>
					<LI>without destroying it if the aim of the experiment is to determine what the system can withstand;</LI>
				</UL>
			<LI>to build and research control strategies;</LI>
			<LI>to forecast and plan the system's future functioning;</LI>
			<LI>to train the personnel and so forth.</LI>
		</OL>
		<P>Simulation is an efficient method but it is not devoid of certain disadvantages. When using simulation, problems are encountered related to describing the system adequately, interpreting the results, providing stochastic convergence of the simulation process, overcoming the dimension problem and others. Another problem with simulation is that it a)&nbsp;is time-consuming / b)&nbsp;involves a lot of work.</P>
		<P><A name="ai"></A><B>Intelligent simulation</B> provides the opportunity of using <B>artificial intelligence methods concentrating on the knowledge aspect</B>, when making simulation decisions, when controlling the simulation experiment, when building the user's interface, when creating simulation model information banks, when using indistinct data and in other cases to overcome the problems mentioned above and make simulation more efficient and attractive for systems analysts.</P>
		<P><B>RAO intelligent medium for simulation modelling (SM)</B> was developed in Moscow State Bauman University of Technology at the Computer Systems for Manufacturing Automation (CSMA) Department. The RAO research and development work was carried out in order to make simulation universal and applicable to any class of systems or processes simulated, to make it easy to correct the models and to model complex control systems together with the object controlled (including SM under on-line regime). There were other reasons too, related to system analysis and control for various complex systems.</P>
		<P>The RAO medium is used for solving the simulation problems described above and for providing a researcher or a designer with new opportunities.</P>
		<P>This version of RAO language is intended to use on personal computers IBM PC under WINDOWS 9x, WINDOWS NT, WINDOWS 2000 and WINDOWS XP.</P>
